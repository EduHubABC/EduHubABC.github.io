## World Languages

Experts estimate that there are between six thousand and seven thousand​ languages in the world. The five languages with the most native speakers are Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Hindi–Urdu<sup>1</sup>, English, and Arabic. Over a third of the people in the world speak one of these as their native language.

| Language   | % of world population (native speakers) |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Mandarin   | 14.4%               |
| Spanish    | 6.2%                |
| Hindi–Urdu | 5.7%                |
| English    | 5.4%                |
| Arabic     | 4.4%                |
| **Top 5 languages** | **36.1%**  |

These numbers are based on the number of *native* speakers of these languages, meaning the people who learned these languages as their main language when they were children. If we include *all* speakers, the numbers are a bit different, with Mandarin still in first place, but with over twice as many total English speakers as Spanish speakers, and more speakers of Hindi–Urdu than Spanish as well.

| Language   | % of world population (all speakers) |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Mandarin   | 20.4%               |
| English    | 18.1%               |
| Hindi–Urdu | 9.5%                |
| Spanish    | 7.4%                |
| Arabic     | 5.9%                |
| **Top 5 languages** | **61.3%**  |

Another difference is that if we include both native and non-native speakers, the top five languages now cover well over half—in fact, nearly two-thirds—of the entire world population. What this means is that if you spoke these five languages, you could speak with over half of the people in the entire world.

The next five most-spoken languages in the world are French, Malay–Indonesian, Portuguese, Bengali, and Russian. Adding these to your repertoire in addition to the top five would let you talk to over seventy-eight percent of the world population. Here is a full list of the top twenty languages in the world by total number of speakers.
